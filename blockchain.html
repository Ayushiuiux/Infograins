                                    <p>There are no regulations on a public blockchain. Anyone with a broadband
                                        connection
                                        can join the network and do proof-of-work validation and transaction processing.
                                        Users that validate blocks typically receive some form of reward in such
                                        networks.

                                    <p>This network uses consensus procedures based on Proof of Work or Proof of Stake
                                        to
                                        validate transactions. It truly is a public network.</p>
                                    <p>The Satoshi model proposed in 2009. This new type of computing technology might
                                        be
                                        referred to as the mother technology. Later, enterprises started to take an
                                        interest
                                        in blockchain technology and designed private blockchains specifically for their
                                        business needs.</p>
                                    <p>You may download the protocol whenever you want in public blockchain
                                        architecture,
                                        and you won't need anyone's permission to do so. They depict the ideal model
                                        that
                                        enables the high profits in the technology business.</p>
                                    <p>This results in an entirely decentralised environment, with no single entity in
                                        charge. Private blockchains can be edited and updated by the entity that owns
                                        them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Public blockchains require a third party for safety and auditing purposes. Like a
                                        flowing river, the system has a natural flow of its own. Flow is abundant, yet
                                        few
                                        people take use of it. What's the easiest way to describe it? An entirely
                                        decentralised, independent, and self-governing digital public ledger.</p>

                                        premise of blockchain at the moment, don't you think? Despite the fact that
                                        private blockchain solutions may appear as centralised networks, they are, in
                                        fact, able to introduce a degree of decentralisation.</p>
                                    <p>Also, in a network like this, you will not be allowed to submit an entry unless
                                        you have a good cause. These kind of networks are ideal for an organisation
                                        since they provide a lot of internal functionality. So, why?</p>
                                    <p>Although technology has advanced greatly in the last decade, prior technologies
                                        simply cannot keep up with the rapidly changing times.</p>
                                    <p>There are many concerns, such as data theft, identity hack, and the like, due to
                                        the existence of these kinds of concerns.</p>
                                    <p>As a result, adopting private blockchains to preserve a company's sensitive
                                        information is the appropriate alternative.</p>
                                    <p>So, there is no way to access this sort of network without authentication.</p>
                                    <p>There are numerous blockchain businesses who are focused on providing a private
                                        version to make sure that any firm may use blockchain.</p>
                                    <p>When Ethereum was first created, it was only made available to the public.
                                        However, EEA is providing an Ethereum private blockchain that is similar to the
                                        one provided by Ethereum, and is complemented by a further layer of anonymity
                                        for these high-end customers.</p>
                                    <h4>Private Blockchain Platforms:</h4>
                                    <p>Private blockchain solutions like Hyperledger are ideal for business applications
                                        like enterprise. For the sake of brevity, here are each of them one by one.</p>

                                                    <p>Ethereum Enterprise is really a recent feature, albeit it was
                                                        announced today. On paper, Ethereum is a public blockchain that
                                                        gained steam because of the advantages it brought to the table.
                                                        However, public networks were hard for private enterprises to
                                                        fully utilise because it's entirely accessible to the public.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>It is precisely because of this that EEA or the Enterprise
                                                        Ethereum Alliance has made the business usage of a private
                                                        Ethereum blockchain version a priority. In conclusion, this
                                                        private Ethereum blockchain employs public network features in
                                                        order to create a new sort of private network.</p>
                                                    <p>It is more correct to say that, moreover, the Ethereum private
                                                        blockchain also updates based on the public network. In other
                                                        words, it will expand into a much larger network.</p>

                                                    <p>This is the last item on our list, as far as I know. JP. Morgan
                                                        is the driving force behind Quorum's success. When compared to
                                                        other cryptocurrencies, Quorum is almost identical to Ethereum,
                                                        except for the fact that it is private. However, in order to
                                                        make the network more adaptable and meet the demands of
                                                        corporations, the developers modified the Ethereum platform to
                                                        fit the needs of their clients.</p>
                                                    <p>Even yet, Ethereum Enterprise and Quorum are two different
                                                        projects. In order to avoid this, keep them straight. One uses
                                                        many approaches and conventions, whereas the other follows a
                                                        fixed methodology.</p>

                                    <p>These private and federated blockchains have certain characteristics in common,
                                        but they also have a difference. Unless you have been granted permission to
                                        enter the network, you will not be able to access the private blockchain.</p>
                                    <p>A private blockchain is a distributed ledger system that allows you to control
                                        access. Only one entity or group needs to supply the entry point to the network.
                                        Depending on the options selected, permissions might be public or even limited.
                                        The uniqueness of this organisation causes it to make the decision.</p>
                                    <p>Some private blockchains allow users to view and share information with other
                                        users, while others do not. It's important to keep in mind that a private
                                        blockchain's characteristics determine how it will be used, and it's not tied to
                                        the design of the system.</p>
                                    <p>Other nodes will not have any degree of access to the network nodes that are
                                        pre-determined to make modifications. For enterprises that want to verify
                                        transactions privately, private blockchains are preferable.</p>
                                    <p>But doesn't that lead to issues with the public blockchain's decentralised
                                        nature? In all honesty, it is. Because private blockchains are not thought of as
                                        a fully decentralised network, this shows that they're centralised.</p>
                                    <p>In contrast, public blockchain suffers from scaling, privacy, and slower
                                        performance. You'll have to give up security to get rid of these. For the most
                                        part, it's useful for a business where there is a lot of trust.</p>
                                    <p>The last piece to the puzzle.</p>
                                    <p>Given this context, it's safe to assume that you are curious where federated
                                        blockchain fits in. It is possible to have both a federated blockchain and a
                                        blockchain consortium implementation, where participants in each get the best of
                                        both worlds. A private blockchain is similar, but there are key differences.</p>
                                    <p>Fed blockchain implementation will diminish the impact of a single company on the
                                        network. A decentralised type system will thus be re-established, employing
                                        numerous entities to simultaneously use the network.</p>
                                    <p>This is a big change since there will be various organisations, all of which will
                                        be using the network for their own purposes. Incorporate your ideas into the
                                        platform as a centre where several groups may interact and perform at the same
                                        time.</p>
                                    <p>In any type of task, regardless of how long it takes, consumers will be able to
                                        fast-forward through any sort of steps.</p>
                                    <p>These separate blockchain systems will link together in this federated blockchain
                                        system, and these organisations will be required to cooperate to retain and
                                        improve the network's functionality. Federation and consortium are names often
                                        used to refer to these groupings. Because this form of blockchain is often
                                        referred to as a “consortium” or “federated blockchain,” it has been named
                                        “consortium blockchain” or “federated blockchain” instead.</p>
                                    <p>Infograins work on different sectors in order to help them to establish their

                                        <p>Population initial coin offerings are a kind of crowdfunding that targets the
                                            broader public. The public offering is a democratised type of investment
                                            since virtually anybody may become an investor. However, because to
                                            regulatory issues, private ICOs are becoming a more realistic choice
                                            relative to public sales.</p>
                                        <p>The growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is helping raise the
                                            appeal of ICOs. In 2017, more over $7 billion was raised through ICOs. In
                                            2018, the figure almost doubled. The largest ICO to date was completed by
                                            Telegram, an instant messaging services provider. During a private ICO, the
                                            UK-registered business raised approximately $1.7 billion.</p>

                                    <p>An initial coin offering is a difficult procedure that needs a profound knowledge
                                        of technology, finance, and the law. In short, ICOs may be defined as
                                        capital-raising operations that include exploiting the decentralised systems of
                                        blockchain technology in order to place the interests of stakeholders on an
                                        equal playing field. Here is the procedure for an ICO:</p>

                                    <p>Every ICO begins with the purpose of raising funds for the firm. Target investors
                                        are targeted for the firm's fundraising effort and are provided with pertinent
                                        company or project information to target them.</p>

                                        creating digital tokens, a blockchain represents an asset or utility. Fungible
                                        and tradeable tokens are used in this system. Do not be mistaken as to whether
                                        the tokens are a type of cryptocurrency. They are adaptations of current
                                        cryptocurrencies. While stocks may give an equity ownership in a corporation,
                                        tokens do not. The vast majority of tokens on the market provide their owners
                                        with a portion of a company's goods or service.</p>
                                    <p>The tokens are produced on blockchain platforms that have been mentioned.
                                        Creating tokens is far simpler than creating new currencies, since there is no
                                        need to develop the code from start. Rather, current blockchain systems, such as
                                        Ethereum, which run current cryptocurrencies, support the generation of tokens
                                        with little variation in the code.</p>
                                    <h6 class="ico_sub_hdng">A company's promotion effort</h6>
                                    <p>At the same time, most companies use a promotion effort to increase the number of
                                        investors they can access. In order to attain the largest number of investors,
                                        the campaigns are usually run online. Although numerous huge platforms,
                                        including as Facebook and Google, now prohibit ICO advertising, ICOs are widely
                                        popular.</p>
                                    <p>the start of a marketing campaign</p>
                                    <p>Once the tokens are created, they are made available to investors. The amount may
                                        be paid over time rather than in one large payment. The firm will then be able
                                        to create a new product or service using the cash from the ICO, while investors
                                        will have the option to utilise the purchased tokens to gain from this
                                        product/service or anticipate token value to increase.</p>
                                    <p>Initial Coin Offering Regulations</p>
                                    <p>A brand new concept for the financial and technological worlds is known as an
                                        initial coin offering (ICO). Since the advent of ICOs, the capital-raising
                                        process has seen a dramatic change. But regulators worldwide were not ready for
                                        the new fundraising paradigm to be introduced into finance.</p>
                                    <p>Some governments regulate ICOs differently. China and South Korea ban ICOs as an
                                        example. ICOs are in the process of being created and governed in a number of
                                        European nations, as well as the United States and Canada.</p>
                                    <p>There are already established rules for ICOs in places like Australia, New
                                        Zealand, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates, which have previously issued
                                        guidelines for it (UAE).</p>
                                    <h4 class="mt-4">IDO</h4>
                                    <p>The first decentralised and permissionless crowdfunding (DFC) platform to employ
                                        the new and interesting type of IDO is an innovative method of gathering funds
                                        for projects in the crypto sector.</p>
                                    <p>An IDO, which is often called a CLO, refers to a project that will issue a coin
                                        or token on a decentralised liquidity market. A pool-based exchange like this
                                        only works if there is enough liquidity to go around. The pairing USDT/ETH, for
                                        instance, is a liquid pair.</p>
                                    <p>IDOs are successors to ICOs, STOs, and ICOs (IEOs). The IDOs are the perfect
                                        solution for new projects and companies who want to issue a token and receive
                                        rapid funding.</p>
                                    <p>By avoiding a pre-mine, which favours project founders above the community, IDOs
                                        are widely regarded a fair approach to establish a new cryptocurrency project.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The first ICO was Mastercoin's July 2013 offering. In 2014, Ethereum conducted a
                                        crowdsale, raising $2.3 million in the first 12 hours with its Ether token.</p>
                                    <p>The first IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) was held on April 17, 2019, and it took
                                        place on the Idax, BitForex, Bit-Z, and Bit-M exchanges. Although, in June 2019,
                                        Raven Protocol unveiled the first-ever IDO which would be listed on Binance DEX,
                                        Raven Protocol had declared in June 2019 that they were launching the IDO, which
                                        had never been done before.</p>
                                    <p>Although the Raven Protocol team maintains that they were unaware of IDO's
                                        existence when they began the project, they credit it as a successful endeavour.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This is a decentralised and distributed deep-learning training system that
                                        incorporates deep neural networks. The Raven Protocol is doing everything it can
                                        to provide cost-effective and speedy solutions that leverage the blockchain to
                                        improve AI and machine learning. To provide compensation for contributing their
                                        computer resources, participants can earn RAVEN tokens while the utility token
                                        is utilised for AI training.</p>
                                    <p>Even though the project's IDO was initially unstable, the Universal Market Access
                                        (UMA) protocol successfully launched. For creators of DeFi platforms, it
                                        provides a way to establish synthetic assets on Ethereum, which are backed by
                                        collateral and can alter in value. The project started its ICO in April via
                                        Uniswap, an Ethereum-based decentralised exchange, which was selling its tokens
                                        for $0.26 each. The pricing worked because UMA used $535,000 worth of Ethereum
                                        in a newly formed liquidity pool.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, token pricing on Uniswap uses a bonding curve instead of order
                                        books, which helps to explain why the price of the UMA token rose so rapidly.
                                        The fact that traders paid greater gas expenses in order to stay ahead of other
                                        dealers ultimately led to the price of UMA tokens increasing by more than $2
                                        minutes after the ICO had begun. Stabilized at around $1.00 with some buyers
                                        saying they paid more than investors who bought in advance. This illustrates the
                                        problem with Uniswap, and not UMA.</p>
                                    <p>Even though it first faced adversity, UMA is presently valued at over $1.5
                                        billion, with one token being priced at over $25.</p>
                                    <p>Similar to the last example, another option for exchanging your crypto assets is
                                        SushiSwap, a decentralised exchange built on Ethereum. SushiSwap aims to become
                                        the most popular Ethereum-based decentralised exchange, replacing Uniswap. Over
                                        $1.14 billion in Uniswap's locked crypto assets were purportedly transferred
                                        over to the SushiSwap platform in September.</p>

                                        to automate an agreement, so that everyone can know the result instantly,

                                    <p>Typical websites have a front end, an API, and a database.</p>

                                    <p>Decentralized apps are a regular Web application with several key differences.
                                        The same technique is used to render the web page on the front end. It has a
                                        “wallet” integrated within it that is in communication with the blockchain. The
                                        wallet keeps track of the cryptographic keys, and keeps track of the blockchain
                                        address as well. It is used for user identification and authentication with
                                        public-key infrastructure. A "smart contract" initiates operations on a
                                        blockchain when it interacts with a wallet. Site which is Web3 compatible:</p>

                                    <p>The front end (including the wallet) connects to the smart contract, which uses
                                        the blockchain.</p>

                                    <p>While Web2 apps may connect to the blockchain using a special application called
                                        "wallet," Web3 apps instead require a connection to the blockchain that is
                                        controlled by a different programme known as "wallet." It records and tracks the
                                        30 unique IDs and blockchain address. We cannot engage with the blockchain
                                        without a device that handles our digital identity. Thus, the Web3 follows on
                                        from the present Web2 stack and adds new features on a component level. In the
                                        backend, the Web3 infrastructure layer builds a decentralised protocol stack for
                                        decentralised apps to interact with. The best way to securely store a user's
                                        private keys is using a decentralised app, on which a cryptographic component
                                        handles a user's private keys, on which transactions may be signed on the
                                        blockchain</p>

                                    <p>Decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi, described</p>

                                    <p>A shortened abbreviation for decentralised finance, DeFi refers to a wide range
                                        of public blockchain applications and initiatives focused on challenging the
                                        status quo in the financial sector. Blockchain technology is a common factor in
                                        decentralised finance (DeFi), also known as financial apps built on blockchain
                                        technologies, and usually employs smart contracts. Smart contracts are binding
                                        agreements that are fully automated and execute automatically, with no
                                        intermediary. These smart contracts may be accessed by anyone with an internet
                                        connection.</p>

                                    <p>DeFi is made up of decentralised apps and peer-to-peer protocols that run on
                                        blockchain networks, and thus allows for peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and
                                        trading of financial tools with no access rights required. Most Decentralized
                                        Financial Institutions (DeFi) apps today are built on the Ethereum network,
                                        however there are others public networks emerging that provide faster
                                        transaction speeds, better scalability, more security, and cheaper prices.</p>

                                    <h6 class="ico_sub_hdng">Where did DeFi come from?</h6>

                                    <p>At first, people exchanged products and services for the betterment of
                                        themselves. The economy did not "develop" at the same rate as people; we
                                        established currency to make trade simpler. This is also why coins played a part
                                        in ushering in new inventions and helping to develop stronger economies. While
                                        things may appear to improve, growth sometimes comes at a price.</p>

                                    <p>Typically, central banks have produced currencies that have been used to sustain
                                        the economies in which they reside, with this eventually giving them increased
                                        influence over the economy. This has happened in the past, which has led
                                        individuals to distrust the competence of centralised authority to handle the
                                        money. The principle of open financial systems was applied in the creation of
                                        DeFi to provide a means of financing without having to trust a central
                                        authority.</p>

                                    <p>According to proponents, DeFi originated in 2009 when the first p2p digital
                                        money, Bitcoin, was launched. The notion of revolutionising the financial world
                                        by decentralising old banking institutions utilising blockchains through Bitcoin
                                        is now a critical step toward that goal. Without the release of Ethereum and
                                        smart contracts in 2015, it would not have been feasible. Ethereum is a
                                        second-generation blockchain. First and foremost, it created the most utility
                                        for financial institutions in using this technology. It stimulated the
                                        development and deployment of initiatives in the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

                                    <p>An explanation of protocols, such as DeFi protocols, and how they operate</p>

                                    <p>The full ecosystem of functional apps and protocols has evolved into a digital
                                        environment where value is provided to millions of users. One of the
                                        fastest-growing sections within the public blockchain landscape is composed of
                                        DeFi ecosystems, which have assets totaling over $30 billion locked up.</p>

                                    <p>Here is a list of the most common use cases and protocols for DeFi services that
                                        are currently available:</p>

                                    <p>blockchain-based lending and borrowing</p>

                                    <p>Lending and borrowing became easier as a result of DeFi's implementation. Many
                                        consider the concept of decentralised financing to be known as "Open Finance."
                                        Lending decisions are no longer monopolised by large banks, and people can
                                        borrow money at a fixed interest rate. To support financial service use cases,
                                        while also satisfying the demands of the bitcoin community, borrowing and
                                        lending are intended.</p>

                                    <p>Compound Finance is the best DeFi lending and borrowing platform.</p>

                                    <p>Compound Finance was established in 2018, conceived by Rober Leshner. This
                                        project utilises the Ethereum blockchain as a means of providing users with
                                        interest on their loan or the opportunity to get financing with collateral. The
                                        Compound protocol makes this feasible by implementing interest rates that set
                                        the price of cryptocurrencies using algorithms running on computers.</p>

                                    <p>distributed exchanges</p>

                                    <p>Decentralized exchanges (DEx) are a crucial piece of DeFi infrastructure, because
                                        they keep the largest amount of cash secured. When using DExs, users may trade
                                        or swap tokens with other assets, such as cryptocurrency, stocks, or other
                                        digital assets, without having to rely on a centralised middleman or custodian.
                                        Similar investing opportunities are available through centralised exchanges, but
                                        their decisions and expenses are subject to their own will and expenses. Also,
                                        the additional charge on each transaction is a disadvantage of CExs, which DExs
                                        work around.</p>

                                    <p>Uniswap is the best decentralised exchange.</p>

                                    <p>The large-volume automated token exchange UniSwap, founded in 2018 by Hayden
                                        Adams, launched in early 2019. After getting funding from numerous financial
                                        ventures, including the Ethereum Foundation, the project was released. The
                                        UniSwap platform automates cryptocurrency trades using smart contracts.</p>

                                    <p>It is as simple as selecting the 'Remove Liquidity' option from a drop-down menu
                                        to get rid of the UniSwap liquidity.</p>

                                    <p>Stablecoins are a realistic option for coping with cryptocurrency market
                                        volatility, and this is helping the DeFi space grow. This clearly describes the
                                        use of stablecoins; they are denominated in fiat currencies such as the US
                                        dollar or gold to keep their value steady. As the crypto market got riskier,
                                        stablecoins were introduced to provide a place of safety for investors and
                                        dealers. They are a reliable collateral asset due to their solidity. Liquidity
                                        pools are a major element of the DeFi ecosystem, and stablecoins are part of
                                        this, too.</p>

                                    <p>makerDAO</p>

                                    <p>MakerDao was founded in 2015 by Rune Christensen, and its goal is to establish an
                                        ecosystem of technology that allows people to save, borrow, and lend using
                                        stable cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum blockchain. It was one of the earliest
                                        DeFi protocols the team had worked on. Instead of an ICO, the project issued
                                        $MKR tokens to support development without a need for an ongoing public
                                        offering. The stablecoin that started in 2018, DAI, has shown considerable
                                        success.</p>

                                    <h6 class="ico_sub_hdng">MakerDAO works as follows:</h6>

                                    <p>That is how the protocol works:</p>

                                    <p>To construct a Collateralized Debt Position, a user can deposit ETH to a smart
                                        contract using Maker's protocol (CDP). The ability to collateralize DAI at a
                                        specified rate is unlocked.</p>

                                    <p>Consider the scenario where the price of $ETH declines in the future. To make
                                        sure the network has sufficient cash backing the loaned tokens, the CDP of a
                                        user will be closed. In order to avoid this, add extra $ETH or remove DAI.</p>

                                    <p>If you want to receive your $ETH back, but you prefer not to pay the additional
                                        cost, just return the exact amount, with the charge included.</p>

                                    <p>The future of decentralised finance is brilliant</p>

                                    <p>A quantum leap has been made in the new opportunities provided by distributed
                                        ledger technology through new capabilities of money. For the first time in
                                        history, the global population will determine the global financial system for
                                        all of humanity. The processes of decentralising financial networks are designed
                                        for the public good and everyone may participate.</p>

                                    <p>While working on the bleeding edge of innovation, the world of decentralised
                                        finance is on the route to riches. Predicting how this area will change as the
                                        ability to develop financial services becomes democratised is tough. But when
                                        the inflection point where DeFI and fintech mapping and merger are achieved,
                                        we'll have a whole new financial system in which embryonic financial technology
                                        plays just a small element. a visionary who realised the promise of speed,

                                        these steps:</p>

                                    <p>reaching an agreement on a specification</p>

                                    <h6 class="ico_sub_hdng">Testing</h6>

                                    <p>symbolic execution tools for manual debugging</p>

                                    <p>in-depth manual examination of the code</p>

                                    <p>the act of creating a report</p>

                                    <p>The project's architecture, design decisions, and construction process are all
                                        explained in the specification and any accompanying documentation. The project's
                                        README file should provide this documentation. When describing the code within
                                        an individual file, including classes, modules, functions, and properties, use
                                        APIs and docstrings to explain some aspects of the code, but they're not a
                                        suitable alternative for a well-written specification. Auditing teams cannot
                                        know if the code is doing what it should be doing if there is no specification.
                                        To ensure the project includes a comprehensive specification, the first stage of
                                        an effective audit is to ensure the project has a complete specification, which
                                        is used as the framework for the audit process.</p>

                                    <p>Once a test, analysis, and even manual analysis has been completed, the auditing
                                        team must put up a report that will be presented to the project team for
                                        discussion and potential action. To complete the audit's work, this last step is
                                        really vital. Project team members should comprehend both the vulnerabilities
                                        and audit team's proposed fixes for the project. Then, these suggestions should
                                        be included into the project. Proactivity is advised when time permits: a
                                        follow-up dialogue or audit is recommended to confirm that there are no more
                                        probable weaknesses in the project.</p>

                                    <p>While there is no exact step-by-step method to conducting a smart contract audit,
                                        a last bit of advice is that there is no "ideal" method. Various teams employ
                                        different design approaches. When everything is said and done, auditing teams
                                        are tasked with making many important judgments, and project teams might
                                        disagree with auditing team recommendations due to subjective, cultural, or
                                        other factors. The solution is somewhere in the middle, which means that while
                                        neither party is inherently more accurate than the other, it will require time
                                        to guarantee that everyone understands the current condition of the project. As
                                        long as all the relevant material is available for debate, there is little to no
                                        risk of failure. When all of this is taken into consideration, it's evident that
                                        communication and careful monitoring are key to smart contract audit success.

                                    <p>Fungibility is the property of products or assets that are interchangeable with
                                        other similar products or assets.</p>

                                    <p>To help you better comprehend, let's go over an example.</p>

                                    <p>Let's pretend you ask a buddy to loan you a $100 bill. Is it really necessary to
                                        return the favour by using the exact same note?</p>

                                    <p>It's a non-starter.</p>

                                    <p>If you give her another $100, you may pay her back. He can even give you two $50
                                        bills or ten $10 bills. In general, currency is fungible, therefore it will be
                                        just fine.</p>

                                    <p>In that case, let's pretend you borrowed your friend's automobile. Is she going
                                        to be ok with you returning another vehicle to her? What if you return her the
                                        entire automobile except the engine, wheels, doors, and other major components?
                                        She could submit a complaint against you if she doesn't find something
                                        objectionable.</p>

                                    <p>As a result, what happened?</p>

                                    <p>While an automobile is considered a collectable, it is non-fungible, making it
                                        not worth trading.</p>

                                    <p>A fungible asset is different from a non-fungible asset in that fungible assets
                                        may be converted into each other, but non-fungible assets cannot.</p>

                                    <p>For currencies to develop value, they must be fungible. As more people use and
                                        accept a money, its perceived value rises. You should make sure the token is
                                        fungible if you care about payment.</p>

                                    <p>Non-fungibility is a good thing since collectable tokens increase in value the
                                        more rare they are.</p>

                                    <p>There are two major standards for Ethereum tokens: ERC-20 versus ERC-721.</p>

                                    <p>It is crucial that Dapps created on top of Ethereum to interact fluidly with one
                                        another to form a healthy ecosystem. In the above situation, one of the tokens
                                        may be an alpha smart contract and the other a beta smart contract.</p>

                                    <p>This implies that if the developers want the two tokens to interact, they will
                                        need to pay close attention to the details of both contracts, and identify
                                        precisely how the two tokens will operate together.</p>

                                    <p>This might be interpreted as meaning that scalability will be an issue because of
                                        this.</p>

                                    <p>As long as there are 100 distinct tokens with 100 separate contracts, you will
                                        need a massive number of sophisticated mathematics to search down and make sure
                                        transfers can go through between all of them. This is the opposite of perfect.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This is why the architecture of the token was standardised, as a result of which
                                        decisions had to be made. ERC-20 sets of regulations are commonly referred to as
                                        the Building Blocks. The “ERC” is a request for comment that was posted on the
                                        Ethereum GitHub repository; the number '20' is allocated to this request.</p>
